{"success":1,"data":{"id":"1","url_slug":"Star-Citizen","name":"Star Citizen","description":"Live Version: 3.2.2 ([more info](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link//16694-Star-Citizen-Alpha-322)) ▪ PTU Version: 3.3.0 All Backers","body":"---\n\n# Quality will always be our number one goal.\n\nWhen we initially set out on this journey we looked out at the gaming landscape and asked: can we do better? We continue to ask that question about everything we do. As a result, we will ALWAYS extend timelines or re-do features and content if we do not feel they are up to our standards. The freedom to fight for a new level of quality in game development is what crowd funding has allowed us to do, and we will continue to fight to make sure Star Citizen and Squadron 42 are the best possible games they can be.\n\n# This roadmap focuses on big features, but is not fully exhaustive. \n\nThere are a lot of behind-the-scenes work and smaller tasks that will be happening as well as on-going improvements to existing features. This is also not intended to be a final list, there will potentially be additional features added down the line and features may shift in their projected release.\n\n# The roadmap data is pulled directly from the internal project management database.\n\nIn the spirit of transparency, the data found on this page is pulled directly from JIRA, our internal database that we are using to plan and manage the project. Feature progress and release plans will be updated here in an automated fashion, once per week.\n\n# Future work estimates are just that: _estimates_.\n\nAll estimates are based on our knowledge and experience but there are many aspects of game development that are impossible to predict because they literally cover uncharted territory. You will see the same estimates we use in our internal planning, but it is important to understand that in many cases (especially with groundbreaking engineering tasks) these estimates are often subject to change due to unforeseen complexity in implementing features.\n\n# Internal schedules, the ones you will now be privy to, tend to have aggressive dates.\n\nThis helps to help the team focus and scope their tasks, especially in the case of tech development. Every team needs target dates, so you may see dates adjust when we get more accurate information and understanding of what’s needed to be completed.\n \n# The polish phase is always hard to estimate, increasingly so in online and multiplayer situations.\n\nThe complexity and the difficulty in testing at a large scale make it harder to reproduce and isolate bugs to fix them. We base our estimates, again, on our experience, but we also know that it’s possible for a single bug to cause a delay of days or weeks when a hundred others might be fixed instantly.\n \n# This roadmap doesn’t cover everything being worked on across Cloud Imperium Games.\n\nThe roadmap is meant to highlight our aims for the remainder of the year on the Persistent Universe. Although technology is shared between the two games, this does not currently reflect the *Squadron 42* roadmap.\n \n\n## Terminology\n\nThe status of each Feature in the roadmap indicates where it is in the development process. Here is a handy list of terms used on each card and their meaning.\n\n|      |                                      |\n| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |\n| **Scheduled**          | The feature is planned but not in development.\n| **In Development**     | The feature is being actively developed.\n| **Polish**             | Work is complete and undergoing playtests and QA.\n| **Completed**          | The feature is considered complete.\n| **Released**            | The feature is shipped as part of a public release.","order":"0","thumbnail":{"id":"1296463","urls":{"square":"/media/8iv5eqjfabb80r/heap_infobox/Logos.png","rect":"/media/8iv5eqjfabb80r/product_thumb_large/Logos.png","large":"/media/8iv5eqjfabb80r/hub_large/Logos.png","source":"/media/8iv5eqjfabb80r/source/Logos.png"}},"background":{"id":"1296458","urls":{"square":"/media/0w04o2ey9m9ikr/heap_infobox/SC_BG_1.jpg","rect":"/media/0w04o2ey9m9ikr/product_thumb_large/SC_BG_1.jpg","large":"/media/0w04o2ey9m9ikr/hub_large/SC_BG_1.jpg","source":"/media/0w04o2ey9m9ikr/source/SC_BG_1.jpg"}},"importer_id":"SC","info_heading":"Roadmap: Caveats","releases":[{"id":"9","url_slug":"310","time_created":1532669581,"time_modified":1537557405,"name":"3.1.0","description":"Released March 31, 2018","board_id":1,"scheduled_at":null,"order":1,"released":1,"importer_id":"3.1.0","cards":[{"id":"355","url_slug":"Helmet-Polish-Lighting-Improvements","time_created":1532669929,"time_modified":1532669929,"board_id":1,"name":"Helmet Polish & Lighting Improvements","scheduled_at":null,"release_id":9,"category_id":3,"importer_id":"236658","description":"Improving overall look of helmets and visual fidelity of lighting.","body":"These improvements will include updates to the model geometry, make sure characters are well lit inside the helmets, and fix bugs such as incidents where the lights persist even when helmets are not on.","order":0,"thumbnail":{"id":"1296482","urls":{"square":"/media/1w9r0ekh3lj0er/heap_infobox/HelmetPolish.jpg","rect":"/media/1w9r0ekh3lj0er/product_thumb_large/HelmetPolish.jpg","large":"/media/1w9r0ekh3lj0er/hub_large/HelmetPolish.jpg","source":"/media/1w9r0ekh3lj0er/source/HelmetPolish.jpg"}},"inprogress":8,"completed":1,"tasks":1,"released":1},{"id":"335","url_slug":"Performance-Optimization","time_created":1532669846,"time_modified":1532669929,"board_id":1,"name":"Performance Optimization","scheduled_at":null,"release_id":9,"category_id":1,"importer_id":"89167","description":"Ongoing performance improvements with specific quarterly goals to increase overall framerate among all PC specs.","body":"General optimization and engine improvements to increase stability and performance for the players.
