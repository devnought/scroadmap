{"success":1,"data":{"id":"2","url_slug":"Squadron-42","name":"Squadron 42","description":"Current milestone: SQ42 Q3 2019 ▪ Latest Roadmap Roundup: 02/07/2020 ([more info](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link?series=roadmap-roundup))","body":"---\n\n# Differences Between The Squadron 42 Roadmap & The Persistent Universe Roadmap\n\n\n# Feature Driven\n\nWhile the Persistent Universe has shifted to a milestone driven schedule of quarterly installments and we are happy to showcase “work in progress” to our community, the focus for Squadron 42 is to deliver an experience that contains both the narrative and feature scope we envision in one final game. As such, Squadron 42 will only be released when we have achieved our final, polished, creative vision. If there is any slip in our quarterly goals, this will push out for the project’s end date. \n\n# Feature Complexity\n\nAs Squadron 42 is a single player experience, the complexity of some features can be simpler than on the Persistent Universe, where additional considerations need to be made to ensure a fun multiplayer experience; this means that a Squadron 42 feature may complete sooner or have less development tasks than its counterpart on the Persistent Universe roadmap.\n\n# Staffing\n\nCloud Imperium Games is continuing to expand the team to support our vision.  The Squadron 42 roadmap makes the assumption that certain hiring targets will be hit by the company to ensure that that the team is fully staffed to complete their tasks on time. Delays in hitting our hiring goals, or sudden fluctuations in personnel may cause changes to the roadmap.\n\n\n# Chapter Considerations\n\nThe Chapters outlined on the roadmap represent breaks in the story and script and shouldn’t be considered as “missions” or the same length of gameplay; some are shorter, some longer and will always differ in the amount of work needed. \n\n# Quality will always be our number one goal.\n\nWhen we initially set out on this journey, we looked out at the gaming landscape and asked: can we do better? We continue to ask that question about everything we do. As a result, we will ALWAYS extend timelines or re-do features and content if we do not feel they are up to our standards. The freedom to fight for a new level of quality in game development is what crowdfunding has allowed us to do, and we will continue to fight to make sure Star Citizen and Squadron 42 are the best possible games they can be.\n \n\n# Roadmap Focuses On Big Features, But Not Fully Exhaustive \n\nBehind-the-scenes work, spoiler-specific, and smaller tasks will be happening in addition to the tasks outlined here, as well as on-going improvements to existing features. This is also not intended to be a final list, there will potentially be additional features added down the line and features may shift in their projected release.\n \n\n# Roadmap Data from Internal Project Management Database \n\nIn the spirit of transparency, the data found on this page is pulled directly from JIRA, our internal database that we are using to plan and manage the project. Feature progress and release plans will be updated here in an automated fashion, once per week.\n\n# Future Work Estimates Are Just That: Estimates \n\nAll estimates are based on our knowledge and experience but there are many aspects of game development that are impossible to predict because they literally cover uncharted territory. You will see the same estimates we use in our internal planning, but it is important to understand that in many cases (especially with groundbreaking engineering tasks) these estimates are often subject to change due to unforeseen complexity in implementing the features.\n\n\n# Internal Schedules Tend To Have Aggressive Dates \n\nThis helps to help the team focus and scope their tasks, especially in the case of tech development. Every team needs target dates, so you may see dates adjust when we get more accurate information and understanding of what’s needed to be completed.\n\n \n# Roadmap Doesn’t Cover Everything\n\nThe roadmap is meant to highlight our aims for the remainder of the year on the Squadron 42. Although technology is shared between the two games, this does not currently reflect the Persistent Universe roadmap.\n\n\n# Terminology\n\nThe status of each Feature in the roadmap indicates where it is in the development process. Here is a handy list of terms used on each card and their meaning.\n\n\n|      |                                      |\n| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |\n| **Scheduled**          | The feature is planned but not in development.\n| **In Development**     | The feature is being actively developed.\n| **Completed**          | The feature is considered complete.\n\n \n\n \n\n ","order":"1","thumbnail":{"id":"1626724","urls":{"square":"/media/ezcbe5nf9yw16r/heap_infobox/S42-2x.png","rect":"/media/ezcbe5nf9yw16r/product_thumb_large/S42-2x.png","large":"/media/ezcbe5nf9yw16r/hub_large/S42-2x.png","source":"/media/ezcbe5nf9yw16r/source/S42-2x.png"}},"background":null,"importer_id":"S42","info_heading":"SQ42 Roadmap: Caveats","releases":[{"id":"35","url_slug":"S42-Q2-2021","time_created":1580503464,"time_modified":1580503464,"name":"S42 Q2 2021","description":"","board_id":2,"scheduled_at":null,"order":0,"released":0,"importer_id":"2021.2","cards":[]},{"id":"32","url_slug":"S42-Q4-2020","time_created":1573245399,"time_modified":1580503464,"name":"S42 Q4 2020","description":"","board_id":2,"scheduled_at":null,"order":1,"released":0,"importer_id":"2020.4","cards":[]},{"id":"23","url_slug":"SQ42-Q2-2018","time_created":1545326705,"time_modified":1580503464,"name":"SQ42 Q2 2018","description":"Complete","board_id":2,"scheduled_at":null,"order":2,"released":1,"importer_id":"2018.2","cards":[]},{"id":"22","url_slug":"SQ42-Q3-2018","time_created":1545326699,"time_modified":1580503464,"name":"SQ42 Q3 2018","description":"Complete","board_id":2,"scheduled_at":null,"order":3,"released":1,"importer_id":"2018.3","cards":[]},{"id":"19","url_slug":"SQ42-Q4-2018","time_created":1545326201,"time_modified":1580503464,"name":"SQ42 Q4 2018","description":"COMPLETE ","board_id":2,"scheduled_at":null,"order":4,"released":1,"importer_id":"2018.4","cards":[{"id":"676","url_slug":"Shipjacker-Medium","time_created":1566586891,"time_modified":1566586891,"board_id":2,"name":"Shipjacker Medium","scheduled_at":null,"release_id":19,"category_id":12,"importer_id":"S42-245118","description":"Implementation of the medium Shipjacker outfit, as well as the loadouts for the characters that require it","body":"Concepting, creation, and implementation of the medium Shipjacker outfit, as well as the loadouts for the characters that require it.","order":0,"thumbnail":{"id":"1586390","urls":{"square":"/media/vmfdbcnp0je6wr/heap_infobox/01-ShipjackerArmor.jpg","rect":"/media/vmfdbcnp0je6wr/product_thumb_large/01-ShipjackerArmor.jpg","large":"/media/vmfdbcnp0je6wr/hub_large/01-ShipjackerArmor.jpg","source":"/media/vmfdbcnp0je6wr/source/01-ShipjackerArmor.jpg"}},"inprogress":15,"completed":0,"tasks":15,"released":1},{"id":"479","url_slug":"RTT-Comm-System-Improvements","time_created":1545326450,"time_modified":1566586891,"board_id":2,"name":"RTT Comm System Improvements","scheduled_at":null,"release_id":19,"category_id":10,"importer_id":"S42-297418","description":"Performance improvements to video-comms rendering","body":"Various performance improvements to the video-comms rendering, such as more aggressive culling, more efficient lighting, and using environment probes for background scenes on lower spec machines.","order":1,"thumbnail":{"id":"1614392","urls":{"square":"/media/t2qct57anag0mr/heap_infobox/NotSignedOff_VideoComms.jpg","rect":"/media/t2qct57anag0mr/product_thumb_large/NotSignedOff_VideoComms.jpg","large":"/media/t2qct57anag0mr/hub_large/NotSignedOff_VideoComms.jpg","source":"/media/t2qct57anag0mr/source/NotSignedOff_VideoComms.jpg"}},"inprogress":1,"completed":1,"tasks":1,"released":1},{"id":"418","url_slug":"Player-Vault-V2","time_created":1545326206,"time_modified":1566586891,"board_id":2,"name":"Player Vault v2","scheduled_at":null,"release_id":19,"category_id":9,"importer_id":"S42-288615","description":"Improvements to the ability for players to leap over obstacles","body":"Continued development of the ability for players to vault across obstacles.

For example, allowing a table to have different numbers of chairs attached to it, without blocking the NPC's ability to stand at the table when a chair is not available.","order":19,"thumbnail":{"id":"1630509","urls":{"square":"/media/ppgsuplmjl8gsr/heap_infobox/NotSignedOff_usable.jpg","rect":"/media/ppgsuplmjl8gsr/product_thumb_large/NotSignedOff_usable.jpg","large":"/media/ppgsuplmjl8gsr/hub_large/NotSignedOff_usable.jpg","source":"/media/ppgsuplmjl8gsr/source/NotSignedOff_usable.jpg"}},"inprogress":62,"completed":10,"tasks":10,"released":1},{"id":"413","url_slug":"Aegis-Idris-M","time_created":1545326165,"time_modified":1579903100,"board_id":2,"name":"Aegis Idris-M   ","scheduled_at":null,"release_id":17,"category_id":8,"importer_id":"S42-34021","description":"Building, implementing, and balancing the Idris-M","body":"Work necessary from the vehicle team to complete the Aegis Idris-M, a military frigate used in the story of Squadron 42, including specific performance capture scene integrations and associated gameplay.","order":20,"thumbnail":{"id":"1630483","urls":{"square":"/media/3deji2lux3sxgr/heap_infobox/NotSignedOff_Idris.jpg","rect":"/media/3deji2lux3sxgr/product_thumb_large/NotSignedOff_Idris.jpg","large":"/media/3deji2lux3sxgr/hub_large/NotSignedOff_Idris.jpg","source":"/media/3deji2lux3sxgr/source/NotSignedOff_Idris.jpg"}},"inprogress":59,"completed":49,"tasks":64,"released":0},{"id":"404","url_slug":"Aegis-Javelin","time_created":1545326135,"time_modified":1581107779,"board_id":2,"name":"Aegis Javelin ","scheduled_at":null,"release_id":17,"category_id":8,"importer_id":"S42-23357","description":"Building, implementing, and balancing the Aegis Javelin destroyer","body":"Work necessary from the vehicle team to complete Aegis Dynamic's military destroyer, the Javelin, for use in the story of Squadron 42.","order":21,"thumbnail":{"id":"1630474","urls":{"square":"/media/ihx6zrp8q9915r/heap_infobox/NotSignedOff_Javelin.jpg","rect":"/media/ihx6zrp8q9915r/product_thumb_large/NotSignedOff_Javelin.jpg","large":"/media/ihx6zrp8q9915r/hub_large/NotSignedOff_Javelin.jpg","source":"/media/ihx6zrp8q9915r/source/NotSignedOff_Javelin.jpg"}},"inprogress":64,"completed":60,"tasks":70,"released":0}]},{"id":"15","url_slug":"SQ42-Q4-2019","time_created":1545326123,"time_modified":1580503464,"name":"SQ42 Q4 2019","description":null,"board_id":2,"scheduled_at":null,"order":8,"released":0,"importer_id":"2019.4","cards":[{"id":"512","url_slug":"Titan-Suit","time_created":1545326678,"time_modified":1545326678,"board_id":2,"name":"Titan Suit","scheduled_at":null,"release_id":15,"category_id":12,"importer_id":"S42-214694","description":"Building, implementing, and balancing the Titan Suit","body":"Creation of the Titan exosuit.
